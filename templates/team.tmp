        <p><span>John Maloney creates live, highly-engaging programming systems for beginners and “casual programmers.” John was the lead developer for Scratch over its first eleven years. Before that, he worked in Dr. Alan Kay’s research group, first at Apple Computer, then at Walt Disney Imagineering, where he helped create the Squeak portable Smalltalk system and Etoys, a programming system for children that was one of the inspirations for Scratch. After leaving the Scratch team in 2013, John lead the creation of GP Blocks, a blocks language aimed at older students and adults. MicroBlocks, his most recent project (in collaboration with Jens Mönig and Bernat Romagosa), is a Scratch-like blocks programming environment for microcontroller boards such as the BBC micro:bit. John got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington. In his free time, John plays the dulcian, the Renaissance ancestor of the modern bassoon.</span></p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/jmoenig" target="_blank">Jens Mönig</a></h3>
        <p><span>Jens Mönig is a researcher at SAP and makes interactive programming environments. He is fanatical about visual coding blocks. Jens is the architect and lead programmer, together with Brian Harvey, of UC Berkeley’s “Snap<i>!</i> Build Your Own Blocks” programming language, used in the introductory “Beauty and Joy of Computing” curriculum. Previously Jens has worked under Alan Kay on the GP programming language together with John Maloney and Yoshiki Ohshima, helped develop Scratch for the MIT Media Lab and written enterprise software at MioSoft. Jens is a fully qualified lawyer in Germany and has been an attorney, corporate counsel and lecturer for many years before rediscovering his love for programming through Scratch and Squeak. For leisure Jens likes guitar picking and strumming his mandolin.</span></p>

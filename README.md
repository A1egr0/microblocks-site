# MicroBlocks website
Official website of the MicroBlocks programming language

### Build system
This website is built using [Snippets](https://github.com/bromagosa/Snippets), my own quick and dirty template system.

### Website

### MicroBlocks Source
If you are looking for the actual MicroBlocks repository, you can find it at [John Maloney's BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/john_maloney/smallvm).
